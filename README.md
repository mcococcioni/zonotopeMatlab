# zonotopeMatlab

This repository contains a mini Matlab toolbox for building
the zonotope of a given set of generators and compute
its volume.

## Getting Started

Download the project within a local folder. 
Then start the demo (see below). That's all! Very easy!

### Prerequisites

Only Matlab is require. The program is expected to work on any
release. It also should work under Octave.

### Installing

There nothing to install. You only need to download the 
following two files:

```
zonotope.m
zonotope_demo.m
```


## Running the demos

The first demo is zonotope_demo1.m, which can be run by entering
zonotope_demo1 at the command line:
```
>> zonotope_demo
```
